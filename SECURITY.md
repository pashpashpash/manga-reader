At "manga-reader" the security of our website is a top priority. We appreciate your help in keeping our project safe and secure. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please follow these steps to report them:

1. **Privately Disclose**: Please do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed by our team.

2. **Contact Us**: Send an email to our security team at [security@mangarecap.ai](mailto:security@mangarecap.ai) with a detailed description of the issue. Include any relevant information, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

3. **Response Time**: We will make our best effort to acknowledge your report within 24 hours and provide an initial assessment of the issue.

4. **Cooperation**: We appreciate responsible disclosure and expect researchers to work with us to resolve the issue in a coordinated manner.

## Security Updates

We are committed to promptly addressing and mitigating any security vulnerabilities that may arise. Once we receive a security report, our team will:

1. Investigate the Issue: We will assess the reported security issue and its potential impact on our users and systems.

2. Develop a Fix: Our development team will work on creating a fix or patch for the vulnerability.

3. Testing: We will rigorously test the fix to ensure it effectively addresses the security concern without causing unintended side effects.

4. Release: Once the fix is ready, we will release it as part of a scheduled update. Critical issues may be addressed on an expedited basis.

5. Public Disclosure: We will work with the researcher to determine an appropriate timeline for public disclosure, ensuring that users have time to update their systems.

## Recognition
