# Manga Recap with GPT-4 Vision

## Project Overview

This project aims to generate summaries of manga chapters by analyzing images extracted from PDF files of the manga. It uses the GPT-4 Vision API to understand the content of manga pages and produce compelling, story-telling tone summaries. The project processes PDFs to extract images, scales them to a specific size, encodes them in base64, and then uses these images as input for the GPT-4 Vision API alongside custom prompts to generate summaries.  Once a summary is generated, it is sent to ElevenLabs API for narration. The resulting narration and relevant panel images are then combined to create a video recap summarizing the volume.

## Features

- PDF processing to extract manga pages as images as well as panel extraction from within pages.
- Image scaling to fit the requirements of the GPT-4 Vision API.
- Base64 encoding of images for API submission.
- Generating text summaries of manga volumes in a story-telling tone.
- Narration of the generated summaries using the ElevenLabs API.
- Video creation from the narration and relevant panel images/pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Pip3 (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation Steps

1. Create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies separately.

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Required Python Packages

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add your OpenAI API key to this file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

5. Prepare Your Manga PDFs

Place your manga volume PDF files in a directory structure as expected by the script, for example, `naruto/v10/v10.pdf`. Additionally, you should have a `chapter-reference.pdf` and a `profile-reference.pdf` in each manga directory. For example, `naruto/chapter-reference.pdf` and `naruto/profile-reference.pdf`. These files are used by GPT vision to identify the chapter pages and character introductions, respectively, so that jobs can be split up by chapter and for characters to be identified correctly by GPT Vision.


## Running the Project

To run the project, execute the `app.py` script from the root directory of your project:
```
python3 app.py --manga naruto --volume-number 10
```

This script processes the specified PDF files, extracts and scales images, encodes them in base64, and sends them to the GPT-4 Vision API for analysis. The summaries generated by the API are printed to the console, including the total tokens used. The script then sends the summaries to the ElevenLabs API for narration. The resulting narration and relevant panel images are then combined to create a video recap summarizing the volume. The video is saved inside the relevant volume directory, i.e. `naruto/v10/recap.mp4`.


## Optional/Recommended running instructions

I personally recommend running this in a Jupiter notebook (`anime_recap.ipynb`), as it allows you run the script one cell at a time, which is useful for debugging and understanding the process.
